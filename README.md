![Image](src/assets/ignite.svg)

This project is simply a lesson review of chapter II of Ignite (track 21)--which is an advanced Javascript course provided by a coding school named Rocketseat.

For those who don't know or do not speak Portuguese, [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) is perhaps the biggest JavaScript community in Brazil.

This lesson review will cover the following topics:

## Figma layout

## Styled-components

## Concepts of global styling

## Advanced React folder structuring

## Modal creation with advanced React libraries

## Context APIs

## React hooks

## HTTP requests with Axios

## TypeScript
